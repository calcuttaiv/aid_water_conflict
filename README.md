- 02_masterthesis_grid_datawork is the file where I set up the foundation of study by arranging the suitable spatial unit for the study as well as manipulating all of the data. Finally a ready-to-be-regressed dataset is created for each country
- 03_masterthesis_data_regression.Rmd is where I run different regressions and export the result tables
